      <p>This letter confirms our discussion today that your employment with Willis Corporation is terminated effective immediately.</p>

      <p>You will receive two weeks severance pay since your employment with Willis Corporation has been less than one year. You will receive the severance payment once you have signed and returned the enclosed release of claims document.Additionally, payment for your accrued PTO will be included in your final paycheck* which you will receive on our regular payday, Friday. You may pick up this check from the reception desk or we can mail it to your home. Let us know your choice.</p>

      <p>You can expect a separate benefits status letter that will outline the status of your benefits upon termination. The letter will include information about your eligibility for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation of group health coverage.We have received from you already your security swipe card, your office key, and the company-owned laptop and cell phone at the termination meeting.You will need to keep the company informed of your contact information so that we are able to provide the information you may need in the future such as your W-2 form.</p>
